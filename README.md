MEDICS "Mi-Squared Encrypted Data Informaton Collection System"
Portable Data Entry Application - (c) 2010

MEDICS is designed to allow quick and easy entry and collection of patient health information, usually in the patient’s home. The system stores local patient recordsencrypted using a local private / public encryption key pair. 

Users may add records manually, or import them from files supplied by the insurance carrier or other sources.

Users will export local records to an outgoing directory, which will render the records unavailable to the local user by deleting the local copy, and storing a copy encrypted using a remote server’s public encryption key in an outgoing directory.
